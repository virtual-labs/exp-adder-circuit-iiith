        "d": "NOR"

      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. XOR gate outputs 1 when inputs are different (complementary). This is the key property used in adder circuits.",
        "b": "Incorrect. NOT gate has only one input, not two.",
        "c": "Incorrect. AND gate outputs 1 only when both inputs are 1.",

      "explanations": {
        "d": "Correct. 10001₂ = 1×2⁴ + 0×2³ + 0×2² + 0×2¹ + 1×2⁰ = 16 + 0 + 0 + 0 + 1 = 17₁₀",
        "a": "Incorrect. Incorrect calculation of binary to decimal conversion.",

      "correctAnswer": "b",
      "explanations": {
        "b": "Correct. The carry signal must propagate through all stages sequentially, creating a delay that increases with the number of bits.",
        "a": "Incorrect. Power consumption is not the main speed limiting factor.",
        "c": "Incorrect. Circuit area does not directly affect speed.",

      },
      "correctAnswer": "d",
      "explanations": {
        "d": "Correct. 1 + 1 = 10 in binary, which means Sum = 0 and Carry = 1. This is fundamental to adder operation.",
        "a": "Incorrect. This would be the result of 1 + 0 or 0 + 1.",
        "b": "Incorrect. This is decimal representation, not binary logic levels.",
