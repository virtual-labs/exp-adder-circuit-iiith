The objective of this experiment is to design and analyze different adder circuits. You will be able to design half adders, full adders, and multi-bit adders.

- **Half Adder**: Design a basic single-bit adder circuit
- **Full Adder**: Implement a complete single-bit adder with carry input capability
- **Multi-bit Adders**: Construct ripple carry adders for multi-bit binary addition

Through this experiment, students will gain practical experience in digital circuit design and understand the fundamental principles of binary arithmetic implementation in hardware.
