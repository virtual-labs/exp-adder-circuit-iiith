The aim of this experiment is to understand and implement different types of adder circuits used in digital systems.

#### What you will learn:

Through this interactive experiment, you will:

- **Understand the fundamentals** of binary addition in digital circuits
- **Design and analyze** half adder circuits for single-bit addition
- **Construct full adder circuits** that handle carry inputs for multi-bit operations
- **Build ripple carry adders** to perform addition of multi-bit binary numbers
- **Explore real-world applications** of adders in processors and digital systems

### Why are adders important?

Adders are fundamental building blocks in digital systems. They are essential components not only in arithmetic logic units (ALUs) but also throughout processors, such as to calculate addresses, table indices, and performing various computational tasks. Understanding adder circuits will give you insight into how computers perform one of their most basic operations - addition.
