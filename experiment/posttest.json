      "correctAnswer": "a",
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Correct. In a half adder, Carry = A AND B, so carry is high (1) only when both inputs are 1.",
        "b": "Incorrect. When both inputs are 0, the AND gate outputs 0, so carry is low.",
        "c": "Incorrect. When inputs are 0 and 1, the AND gate outputs 0, so carry is low.",
        "d": "Incorrect. When inputs are 1 and 0, the AND gate outputs 0, so carry is low."

        "a": "Incorrect. The Sum outputs of the full adders at each stage in a ripple carry adder are calculated as: SUM = A XOR B XOR Cin",
        "b": "Incorrect. In each full adder of a ripple carry adder, ((A XOR B) AND Cin), (A AND B) are given as inputs to an OR Gate to get the Carry Output of that full adder.",
        "c": "Correct. None of the intermediary or final stages/gates in a ripple carry adder output this boolean expression.",
        "d": "Incorrect. In each full adder of a ripple carry adder, ((A XOR B) AND Cin), (A AND B) are given as inputs to an OR Gate to get the Carry Output of that full adder. So, CarryOut = (A AND B) OR (Cin AND (A XOR B)) for each full adder."

        "a": "Correct. Half adder uses XOR gate for Sum (A ⊕ B) and AND gate for Carry (A · B).",

        "a": "Incorrect. One input line is insufficient for addition operations.",
        "b": "Incorrect. Two input lines would be for a half adder, not a full adder.",
